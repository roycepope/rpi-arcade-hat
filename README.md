# RPi Recalbox Arcade Control Interface Module
This is a Kicad project of a PCB design for a DIY Arcade system. The goal was to design a PCB that could be easily connected to buttons via JST connectors and the standard Raspberry Pi 40-Pin GPIO header. This is a two layer board with the Top Copper layer being the main signal layer and the bottom board being the ground plane.
